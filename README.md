## General info
The project was created as part of the "100 Commits on GitHub" challenge initiated by "DevMentors" - a group of highly talented individuals founded by Dariusz Pawlikiewicz, Michał Wilczyński, and Piotr Gankiewicz. I decided to create a dynamic website showcasing several classic games such as Snake, Pong, Slide, and many others. The aim of the project is not only to acquire skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML but also to provide entertainment through interactive games.
	
## Snake Game
In the classic Snake game, your goal is to control a snake moving around the board. You must collect flashing objects to make the snake grow while avoiding collisions with itself. As the snake grows longer, it becomes increasingly challenging to keep it under control. The game ends when the snake collides with itself.
	
## Slide Game
Slide Game is a puzzle game where you have to slide blocks around the board to guide a selected block to its designated goal. With each subsequent level, the difficulty increases, requiring players to demonstrate greater dexterity and logical thinking.

## Pong Game
Pong is a classic arcade game where two players compete against each other, controlling paddles to bounce a ball in such a way that the opponent cannot catch it. The game ends when one side reaches a specified number of points or when one side fails to catch the ball.

## Merge Game
Merge Game is a game based on the principles of merging blocks of different colors or numerical values. Your goal is to merge blocks with the same values to create blocks with higher values and maximize your score. The game ends when the board is full and there are no more opportunities to merge blocks.

Connect two squares with the same value:

You can connect more than just two squares with the same value, which gives you extra points:

When you connect squares with a value of 2048, an additional 4096 points are added to your score, and the squares free up space:
